== NAME

AKMBUILD - metadata and instructions to build a dynamic kernel module


== SYNOPSIS

**/usr/src/*/AKMBUILD**


== DESCRIPTION

An *AKMBUILD* file is used by {akms} tool to build and install an out-of-tree dynamic kernel module on the user`'s system.
It defines metadata such as the name and version of the module, list of the kernel objects to be installed and additional build dependencies.
It may also contains the commands needed to build the module if the default one is not suitable.

The *AKMBUILD* format is a POSIX shell script with pre-defined set of variables and functions, just like {APKBUILD}.


== VARIABLES

=== Required Variables

The following variables MUST be defined by the author of the *AKMBUILD* file.

*modname*::
Specifies name of the module.
This is typically the name of the APK package providing the source code of the module and the *AKMBUILD* file, but without the `-src` suffix.
The same rules as for the APKBUILD `pkgname` applies.

*modver*::
Specifies the version of the module being built and installed.
This is typically the version of the APK package providing the source code of the module and the *AKMBUILD* file (without `pkgrel`).
The same rules as for the APKBUILD `pkgver` applies.

*built_modules*::
Specifies a space-separated list of kernel object files (with `.ko` suffix), as relative paths from the directory containing *AKMBUILD*, that are expected to be built and eventually installed into the kernel modules tree.


=== Optional Variables

The following variables MAY be defined by the author of the *AKMBUILD* file.

*makedepends*::
Specifies additional build dependencies for the module.
The kernel source code (dev package) and base build toolchain (package `build-base` in Alpine Linux) are implicit and should not be defined here.


=== Environment Variables

The following variables are always provided by {akms} and MUST NOT be overriden.

*kernel_ver*::
Specifies a full release version of the kernel for which the module is being built (e.g. `5.10.53-0-lts`).

*kernel_srcdir*::
Location of the kernel`'s source directory.

The following variables are provided by {akms} when running the *build* function and MUST NOT be overriden.

*srcdir*::
Location of the module`'s source directory containing *AKMBUILD*.
This directory is read-only.

*builddir*::
Location of the directory where the module should be built.
It is initialized with a copy of the *srcdir* and it is the only writtable directory for building the module.

*MAKEFLAGS*::
Flags to give to make(1) to build the module.
The default value of this variable can be specified in {akms-conf}.


== FUNCTIONS

The following functions MAY be overridden by the author of the *AKMBUILD* file.

*build*::
Builds the kernel module(s) in the *builddir*.
+
The default implementation calls function *default_build*:
+
[source, sh]
touch "$builddir"/Makefile
make ${MAKEFLAGS:-} -C "$kernel_srcdir" M="$builddir" modules


== EXAMPLES

[source, sh]
.AKMBUILD:
----
modname=rtw89
modver=5_git20210715
built_modules='rtw89core.ko rtw89pci.ko'

build() {
    touch "$builddir"/Makefile
    make $MAKEFLAGS -C "$kernel_srcdir" M="$builddir" modules
}
